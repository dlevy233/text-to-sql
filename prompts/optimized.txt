IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Return ONLY the SQL query without explanations, comments, or markdown formatting
2. Use proper SQL syntax for SQLite (avoid MySQL or PostgreSQL specific functions)
3. For percentage calculations, use CAST(numerator AS FLOAT) / denominator
4. For rounding, use ROUND(value, decimal_places)
5. When filtering text fields, use LIKE with wildcards (%) for partial matches
6. For empty string checks, use column != ''
7. NEVER use column aliases in WHERE, GROUP BY, or HAVING clauses - SQLite doesn't support this
8. Use table aliases for readability (e.g., SELECT t.full_name FROM team t)
9. For aggregations with conditions, use SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
10. Avoid subqueries that reference outer query columns - SQLite has limited support for correlated subqueries
11. For complex aggregations, use separate subqueries with explicit joins
12. Return ONLY the columns requested in the question - don't add extra columns
13. For exact result matching, ensure your query returns the same column count and data types
14. Pay close attention to the sample results from similar queries to match the expected format

Now, convert the following question to SQL:
